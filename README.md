# Sorted-logs-in-one-file-from-var-log-tar-file-without-manual-extraction-
This script will extract message log , syslog and chassisd logs from the var/log tar file(without manual extraction)
And sorted logs will be put in 3 different file message , syslog , chassisd
Which can used befor manual log analysis or we can extend this script to further automate the log analysis.
(this is really useful if we are using windows PC and using notepad++ for log analysis.)
